Gradio is being considered as our secondary option for creating interfaces to test our models. While it offers simplicity and ease of use, we are evaluating it alongside another option to determine the most suitable interface for our needs. Factors such as ease of implementation, flexibility, community support, compatibility with our existing tech stack, scalability, and security are being taken into account during this evaluation process. By exploring both options, we aim to make an informed decision that aligns with our specific requirements and goals for testing and showcasing our machine learning models.
