Gradio is being considered as our secondary option for creating interfaces to test our models. While it offers simplicity and ease of use, we are evaluating it alongside another option to determine the most suitable interface for our needs. Factors such as ease of implementation, flexibility, community support, compatibility with our existing tech stack, scalability, and security are being taken into account during this evaluation process. By exploring both options, we aim to make an informed decision that aligns with our specific requirements and goals for testing and showcasing our machine learning models.

here's a condensed overview for image detection:
1. **Facial Feature Analysis**: Look for inconsistencies in facial geometry and expressions.
2. **Inconsistency Detection**: Identify anomalies in lighting, shadows, and reflections.
3. **Forensic Analysis**: Analyze artifacts, metadata, and compression clues.
4. **Feature Extraction**: Train machine learning models to distinguish between real and fake images.
5. **GAN Detection**: Focus on artifacts introduced during GAN training.
6. **Semantic Analysis**: Check for coherence between facial expressions, gestures, and backgrounds.
7. **Deep Learning Architectures**: Utilize CNNs, RNNs, and attention mechanisms for detection.
8. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple detection techniques for improved accuracy.
